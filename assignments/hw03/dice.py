=====
Roll three three-sided dice 1000 times.  Keep track of the number of each 
potential result (3 - 9). 

* create a histogram showing the results 
* you can count by 10's using an = to represent each 10 in the histogram... 
* you can use division, the built in round() function, and int to convert from
  float to int to get the number of ='s to do this
* for example: round(2.5) returns a float... use int to change it to an int: 
  int(round(2.5))... and finally use that to multiply your string
