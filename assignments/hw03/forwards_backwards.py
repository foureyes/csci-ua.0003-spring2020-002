=====
* print out: "Using while loops"
* use two while loops to:
    * count forward from 3 to 30 by 3's, skipping numbers divisible by 4
    * count backwards from 30 to 3 by 3's, skipping numbers divisible by 4
    * do not explicitly check for == 12 and == 24; use modulo (%) to determine
      if divisible by 4 instead
* print out: "Using for loops"
* use two for loops to mimic the same functionality above:
    * count forward from 3 to 30 by 3's, skipping numbers divisible by 4
    * count backwards from 30 to 3 by 3's, skipping numbers divisible by 4
    * do not explicitly check for == 12 and == 24; use modulo (%) to determine
      if divisible by 4 instead
