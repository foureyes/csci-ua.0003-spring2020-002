=====

Create a turtle program that draws multiple objects  

* It should use a list of dictionaries to define the properties of each 
  object in your drawing. 
* There should be at least 10 different objects in different locations on 
  the screen.
* For example, you can draw multiple trees (simply a rectangle and triangle)
  ...and the dictionary would have keys that may represent:
  * the tree's total height
  * the x and y coordinate

Create any drawing you like! As long as the drawing uses the list of 
dictionaries as the basis of where/how things are drawn.
