=====
Write three functions that work with nested lists:

1. find_by_name(name, animals)
2. stringify_animals(animals)
3. get_most_urgent(animals)

The parameter, animals, will be a list of lists representing a collection 
of animals at veterinary clinic (animal hospital!). The outer list is all 
of the animals, while each inner list is a single animal with:

* a name ('jane clawston')
* a type / kind ('cat')
* a number representing urgency - 0-100, with 100 the most urgent and 0 as
not urgent at all)

The attributes listed above for a single animal is represented by a 3 
element list:

* name will be at index 0
* type will be at index 1
* urgency will be at index 2

For example, a cat named 'jane clawston' that does not have an urgent issue
can be represented as:

['jane clawston', 'cat', 10]

So... a list of animals will look like: 

#             animal 1 ------+            animal 2 ------+ 
#                            |                           |
animals = [['jane clawston', 'cat', 10], ['franz catka', 'cat', 2]] 

Write the following functions that have a list of animals as a parameter.

find_by_name:
-----
Returns the animal with the name specified from a list of animals. 

* parameters: 2 - a string (the name to search for), and a list of animals
* processing:
    1. go through every animal in the list
    2. checks the name
    3. if the name matches the supplied name, give back that animal
* return value: a single animal (a list) or None if the animal is not found

examples:

animal_list = [['sam', 'snake', 4], ['gertrude', 'goat', 99]]
res = find_by_name('sam', animal_list) 
print(res) # ['sam', 'snake', 4]


stringify_animals:
-----
Create a string representing the list of animals using their name, kind, 
and the position they're in within the list (using 1 as the first animal, 
rather than 0).

* parameters: a list of animals
* processing:
    1. go through every animal in the list
    2. accumulate each animal's position, name and type
* return value: the resulting string formatted as:

1 - sam, snake
2 - gertrude, goat
3 - ang, unicorn

examples:

animal_list = [['sam', 'snake', 4], ['gertrude', 'goat', 99], ['ang', 'unicorn', 50]]

# returns the string: "1 - sam, snake\n2 - gertrude, goat\n3 - ang, unicorn"
res = stringify_animals(animal_list)

print(res)

1 - sam, snake
2 - gertrude, goat
3 - ang, unicorn


get_most_urgent:
-----
This function will find the animal that has the most urgent issue in a list of animals.

* parameters: a list of animals (a list of lists)
* processing:
    1. iterates through entire list of animals
    2. checks the urgency value of each animal
    3. finds the animal with the highest urgency value
    4. if urgency values are the same, choose any animal (it's easiet to
       just choose the last one with the highest value)
* return value: a single animal (a list)

examples:

animal_list = [['sam', 'snake', 4], ['gertrude', 'goat', 99]]
print(get_most_urgent(animal_list))
# will print out ['gertrude', 'goat', 99]
